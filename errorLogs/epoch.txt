To convert standard date/time to epoch time (i.e., Unix timestamp) for use in SQL queries against chat.db (from iMessage), here are the two main formats you'll need to understand:

🧱 1. Standard Unix Epoch
Counts seconds since Jan 1, 1970 (UTC)

Example:
2021-10-01 00:00:00 UTC → 1633046400

You can generate this using:

bash
Copy
Edit
date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" "2021-10-01 00:00:00" "+%s"
or in JavaScript:

js
Copy
Edit
Math.floor(new Date("2021-10-01T00:00:00Z").getTime() / 1000); // 1633046400
🍏 2. Apple's Cocoa Epoch (Used in chat.db)
Counts seconds since Jan 1, 2001 00:00:00 UTC

This means you need to subtract 978307200 from the standard Unix epoch.

✅ Example with your date:
text
Copy
Edit
Standard Epoch for 2021-10-01 00:00:00 UTC:       1633046400
Cocoa Epoch (Apple):                             1633046400 - 978307200 = 655739200
🧠 SQL Usage in chat.db
If you're querying messages:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT text, datetime(date + 978307200, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') AS sent_at
FROM message
WHERE date > 655739200
ORDER BY date DESC;
If you want messages from October 1, 2021 onward, use:

sql
Copy
Edit
WHERE date > 655739200
